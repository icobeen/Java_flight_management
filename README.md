# Airport_management_system
This Java application features a dashboard with four main options for managing various aspects of flight operations. The ManageFlight class handles all flight-related details, including the number of seats, flight source and destination, and flight codes. The ManagePassenger class manages passenger information, such as passenger names, gender, nationality, passport numbers, and phone numbers. Additionally, the application includes a TicketBooking class for booking tickets and a TicketCancellation class for canceling tickets, providing a comprehensive system for flight and passenger management.
## Login 
Here, it consults a database to verify the login credentials entered by the airport worker responsible for managing the flight system. If the credentials exist in the database, access to the dashboard is granted; otherwise, access is denied.
